# **Flashing lights warning!**

# WHAT IN THE FUNKIN'?!  
### **An experimental fork of FNF dedicated to adding modchart support!**  
**By Hazard24**  

*If you're looking for the main repository, look here:  *
https://github.com/Hazardous2468/What-In-The-Funkin  


### This repository contains all of the example songs that were previously included in releases of WITF.  

*Note that not everything is mine (mainly the music)!  
All credits should hopefully be given in each mods '_polymod_meta' file*
